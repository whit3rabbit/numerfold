    Identify natural feature domains using dimensionality reduction and clustering.

    This function standardizes the input features, reduces their dimensionality

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the input data.
        features (list): List of feature column names from the DataFrame.
        n_clusters (int): Desired number of clusters/domains (default: 10).
        random_state (int): Seed for reproducibility (default: 42).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - feature_groups (dict): Dictionary mapping domain names to lists of features.
            - embedding (np.ndarray): 2D embedding of features after dimensionality reduction.
